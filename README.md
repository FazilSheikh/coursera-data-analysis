# [Coursera] Data Analysis: Lecture Notes & Course Work

These are my notes, experiments, and coursework for the
[Data Analysis](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/class/index) course
on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), taught by
[Jeffrey Leek](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/) (see also:
[Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/)). The one-liner description of
the course from the Coursera site:

> Learn about the most effective data analysis methods to solve problems and
> achieve insight.

## About this Repository

The course uses [R](http://www.r-project.org/) as the primary tool for
conducting data analyses. Leeks recommends using [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/),
and so do I. (Also: do yourself a favor and get R Studio set up to use
[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown).)

The general layout here:

* `lectures` - Lecture notes and associated materials.
* `quizzes` - "Showing my work" for the quizzes. (These are ignored with
  `.gitignore` until the course is over or until the quizzes are "over"; can't
  have anyone cheating, after all.)
